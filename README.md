# Mumble Link in GTFO
This is a mod I developed for use in [my videos](https://youtube.com/@PerfectMachine/). In the latest update, I added the ability to wake up sleepers via talking in Mumble. üëÄ

The setup process is lengthy and tedious but I genuinely think it pays off. I spent a lot of time on making sure nobody is confused anywhere through the process so you can either use the [Wiki](https://github.com/WWYDF/OpenPA/wiki) to walk you through it, or you can watch the [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/mMbHiqQQSqk?t=0) below. ‚ù§Ô∏è
